# BECS2_dataChallenge
BECS2 data challenge HS21

The aim of the project work is to work independently on a project, which involves researching a topic, analyzing and visualizing data, developing machine learning models with the tool covered in the course (mainly scikit-learn) and discussing the results.

The project can be done by single persons or in teams of up to four people.

Instructions Please take note of the following instructions/guidelines: • Choose a problem that can be solved with the methods discussed in the course.
• Find an appropriate data set for your task. (See e.g. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ index.php or https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
• Explain the task to be solved. • Point out, possibly, related work or problems in the literature/internet.
• Analyze your data. Visualize and explain the data features you deem to be relevant for the project.
• Explain your approach. That is, explain your model, the model architecture, optimizers, regularization, etc. used.
• Experiment with your model: change it, tune hyperparameters, etc. Do not copy paste a model without substantially adopting it to your problem/task. Explain your final model.
• Show, explain, and visualize your results. • Point out problems encountered. • Point out further work or ideas.
• The code needs to be clearly documented.
