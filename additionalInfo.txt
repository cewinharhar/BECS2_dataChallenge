################################################

Read this before working with the data!


the folder data/ includes the following:

- raw.xls
--> raw data which needs to be processed (with python). The size is roughly 550 mb which will end in way less. raw.xls is the raw output from a FAIMS-TOF-MS measurment. 


- tidy.csv
--> The processed output of raw.xls. We can already built our model with this file. The features shortly explained
	R.FileName 	= The sample identifier. Each entry corresponse to an individual patient.
	uniprot 	= The uniprot accession number of the protein.
	proteinName	= The protein Name (one Name can have multiple Uniprot numbers but not in this dataset)
	Group		= The health status of the patients. Is either Healthy or a different kind of cancer.
	fastaSequence	= The protein Aminoacid sequence. 
	meanAbu		= The mean Abundance (equivalent to concetration) of each protein. It may varry between patients
	log10meanAbu	= log10(meanAbu)
	stdDev		= standard deviation of meanAbu (But is not needed due to the single measurment per patient)
	relStdDev	= coefficient of variation (relative standardabweichung) of meanAbu (But is not needed due to the single measurment per patient)
	Rank		= Rank position of the proteins for each patient (Ascending)

- raw2tidy.R 
--> an R script to directly transform raw.xls to tidy.csv. Can be translated into python. Use the package data.table for a super fast read in of raw.xls.
    It may take 1-4 minutes depending on your computer speed

- metadata.csv 
--> is used by raw2tidy.R, includes information about patient, column used etc

- proteinSeqInfoExt.csv
--> is used by raw2tidy.r, includes feature infos about the proteins like sequence, physikochemical etc..
